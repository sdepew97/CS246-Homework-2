Assignment 2 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)
This assignment was more difficult that the first assignment, because I got very stuck on the final two questions. The first of the final two questions I figured out by doing some google research and sussing out the algorithmic approach to convert decimals to hexadecimal. Please note that I did not look at any code during this research. 

Eventually, for the other problem however, I did go into the TA for the hex to octal conversion, because I just could not figure it out and had already spent countless hours not understanding it. Rachel helped me to think through the problem and then I was able to write the code and finish the problem well. 


2. What was hard about this assignment?
The final two questions. 
 
3. What would you like to know more about?
I am not sure. :)

4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)
This assignment took me 10+ hours, because I got stuck on the last two questions.
